# angular-vs-treeview

This is simple angular treeview component.

```
 <treeview #treeView1 [treeItems]="treeItems" [treeConfig]="treeConfig" (onNodeSelected)="nodeSelected($event)"
    (onLazyLoadNodeExpand)="onLazyLoadNodeExpand($event)"></treeview>
```

There might be some glitches please forgive me for that. :)
